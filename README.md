# my_message_generator
For this project, I have built a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. To make this program truly random, the message that it outputs is made up of three different pieces of data. I have had a bit of fun using 'good deeds'!

Project Objectives:
Build a message generator program using JavaScript
Use Git version control
Use command line
Develop locally on your computer
Prerequisites:
JavaScript
Git and GitHub
